GBA DMA Autograder Template
===========================

For information on what this is and how it works, see:
<http://austinjadams.com/blog/autograding-gba-dma/>. In short, it's an
autograder for Gameboy Advance [DMA][1], a concept which plays an
important role in CS 2110 at Georgia Tech.

In this example assignment, students draw an image on the top-left
corner of the screen. It's a simplification of Timed Lab 06 from Fall
2018, the assignment for which I wrote all this DMA stuff.
